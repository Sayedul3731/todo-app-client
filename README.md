## Short overview of the project
* It is a task management app. A person can easily keep a note of his daily tasks through this app. But he has to login first. Then have to go to Navbar's task management route. The route will redirect him to the task management page where he can create new tasks, delete them, update them. Again he/she can set which task has been completed and which one has not been completed. If he/she want to convert a task from incomplete to completed, he/she can do that too.
## Deploy
* Server side deployed in vercel and frontend side deployed in firebase.
## Technologies
* I used ReactJS and Bootstrap for frontend and NodeJS, ExpressJS, MongoDB for backend.
